Be careful! A sea turtle is ahead!
This turtle walks around normally...
But every few seconds, it hides in its shell!
The shell is INDESTRUCTIBLE - you cannot break it!
Touching the turtle OR its shell will hurt you!
Wait for it to come out, then attack quickly with C!
Or just jump over it and keep running!
