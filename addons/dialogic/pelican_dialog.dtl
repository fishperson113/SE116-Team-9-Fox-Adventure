Look up! A blowfish is flying above!
It flies back and forth, 200 pixels high in the air.
Every 2 seconds, it drops a spiked ball at your position!
The spiked balls deal damage like spikes if they hit you!
Keep moving to avoid the falling spikes!
After 10 seconds, the blowfish will fly away.
You can throw your weapon with V to hit it...
Or just run through the area quickly!
